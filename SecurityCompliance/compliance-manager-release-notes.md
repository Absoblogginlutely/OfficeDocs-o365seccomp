# Release Notes for Compliance Manager Version 3 (Preview)

The Public Preview of Compliance Manager provides you with early access to upcoming functionality and updates.

You can use the updated [Compliance Manager Version 3 (Preview)](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ComplianceManager) tool on the [Service Trust Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com) to track, assign, and verify regulatory compliance activities related to Microsoft cloud services.

## Whatâ€™s new in Compliance Manager Version 3 (Preview)

- **Integration with Microsoft Secure Score**: Compliance Manager supports integration with [Microsoft Secure Score](microsoft-secure-score.md) by mapping customer-managed Actions to almost 100 Secure Score actions. When you complete a mapped action in Secure Score, the corresponding Compliance Manager Action automatically completes.

- **Templates**: In addition to the standard Assessment templates available in previous versions, Compliance Manager now supports importing custom templates from Excel workbooks.

- **Actions Items**: Action Items are now individual items and most include telemetry collection from the Microsoft Secure Score Graph API. Where possible, technical action recommendations now have links to the applicable configuration page in the Office 365 service.

- **Ownership**: A responsible party is defined for Controls and Action Items as an Owner, mirroring the Responsible Party in Microsoft Trust Tools. One or more people or teams are assigned responsibility for Control implementation.

- **Dimensions**: New metadata for Action Items that allows configuring custom pivots for filters.

- **Compliance Score**: The methodology has changed to support syncing with Microsoft Secure Score. The scoring system removes the Microsoft-managed control credits and focuses solely on the completion of customer-managed controls. Multiple dimensions are used to calculate the score on a per-action basis. Compliance score data is a requirement for each template and Assessment.

- **In-scope Services**: In-scope Services are added to the data schema and are a requirement for each template and Assessment.

- **Separate Excel workbooks**: Each template and Assessment have independent Excel workbooks with six tabs for easier mapping across multiple standards. The new tabs are:

    - Template-Assessment
    - Controls
    - Actions
    - Ownership
    - Dimensions
    - Microsoft

## Known issues in Compliance Manager Version 3 (Preview)

The following sections cover known issues to be resolved in an upcoming release of Compliance Manager Version 3.

### Compliance Score

- When Action Items are marked as **Not in Scope**, the score assigned to the Action Item is not excluded from the Compliance Score calculation. Action Items marked **Not in Scope** should not increase your Compliance Score.

### Customization

- Adding custom Controls enables adding a new control to an existing control family, but it does not allow you to add a new Control Family.
- This release does not support linking Action Items or adding Actions Items or Controls to an Assessment.

### Filters

- Filtering on Action Items or Controls does not consistently produce correct results.

### Templates

- Archived templates are editable and they should not be editable.
- Locked templates allow for Assessment creation when they should not. Locking a Template is meant to prevent it from being used to create Assessments.

### Export

- Template export to JSON fails when the template status is set to **Imported** or **Pending Approval**.

### Supported browsers

- The latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Chrome, and Safari are supported.
- There may be instances where updated data does not appear until your browser is refreshed.
- The preview version of Microsoft Edge is not supported but has no known issues.
- Internet Explorer is not supported.
