# Release notes for Compliance Manager (Version 3 Preview)

You can use the updated [Compliance Manager (Version 3 Preview)](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ComplianceManager) tool on the [Service Trust Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com) to track, assign, and verify your organization's regulatory compliance activities related to Microsoft Professional Services and Microsoft cloud services. The Public Preview of Compliance Manager provides you with early access to the upcoming functionality and updates.

## Whatâ€™s new in Compliance Manager Version 3 Preview

- **Integration with Microsoft Secure Score**: Compliance Manager is integrated with [Microsoft Secure Score](microsoft-secure-score.md) by mapping customer-managed Actions to almost 100 Secure Score actions. When you complete a mapped action in Secure Score, the corresponding Compliance Manager Action is automatically completed.

- **Templates**: In addition to the standard Assessment templates available in previous versions, Compliance Manager now supports importing custom templates from Excel workbooks.

- **Actions Items**: Action Items are now individual items and most include telemetry collection from the Microsoft Secure Score Graph API. Where possible, technical action recommendations now have links to the applicable configuration page in the Office 365 service.

- **Ownership**: A responsible party is now defined for Controls and Action Items, mirroring the Responsible Party in Microsoft Trust Tools. One or more people or teams are assigned responsibility for implementing a Control.

- **Dimensions**: New metadata for Action Items that allows configuring custom pivots for filters.

- **Compliance Score**: The methodology has changed to support syncing with Microsoft Secure Score. The scoring system removes the Microsoft-managed control credits and focuses solely on the completion of customer-managed controls. Multiple dimensions are used to calculate the score on a per-action basis. Compliance score data must be provided for each template and Assessment.

- **In-scope Services**: In-scope Services are added to the data schema and now are a requirement for each template and Assessment.

- **Separate Excel workbooks**: Each template and Assessment have independent Excel workbooks with six tabs for easier mapping across multiple standards. The new tabs are:
    - Template-Assessment
    - Controls
    - Actions
    - Ownership
    - Dimensions
