# Quarantine

The following topics provide information about the hosted quarantine for both Exchange Online and Exchange Online Protection (EOP) admins and end users:
  
- [Quarantine FAQ](quarantine-faq.md) - Provides general questions and answers about the quarantine for both admins and end users 
    
- [Find and release quarantined messages as an administrator](find-and-release-quarantined-messages-as-an-administrator.md) - Describes how admins can find and release any message that resides in the quarantine in the Exchange admin center (EAC), and optionally report it as a false positive (not junk) message to Microsoft. 
    
- [Find and Release Quarantined Messages (End Users)](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/e439b560-827a-4807-abd3-6b861c1ff786.aspx) - Describes how end users can find and release their own spam-quarantined messages in the spam quarantine user interface, and report them as not junk to Microsoft. 
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > In order to access the end user spam quarantine, end users must have a valid Office 365 user ID and password. EOP customers protecting on-premises mailboxes must be valid email users created via directory synchronization or the EAC. For more information about managing users, EOP admins can refer to [Manage mail users in EOP](eop/manage-mail-users-in-eop.md). For EOP standalone customers, we recommend using directory synchronization and enabling Directory Based Edge Blocking; for more information, see [Use Directory Based Edge Blocking to Reject Messages Sent to Invalid Recipients](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ca7b7416-92ed-40ad-abdb-695be46ea2e4.aspx). 
  
- [Use end-user spam notifications to release and report spam-quarantined messages](use-end-user-spam-notifications-to-release-and-report-spam-quarantined-messages.md) - Describes how end users can release their own spam-quarantined messages and optionally report them as not junk via end-user spam notification messages.
