# Get started with the Microsoft Service Trust Portal

The Microsoft Service Trust Portal (STP) provides a variety of content, tools, and other resources about Microsoft security, privacy and compliance practices. It also includes independent third-party audit reports of Microsoft's online services, and information about how our online services can help your organization maintain and track compliance with standards, laws, and regulations, such as:
  
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
    
- Service Organization Controls (SOC)
    
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    
- Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
    
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  
## Accessing the Service Trust Portal

The STP contains details about Microsoft's implementation of controls and processes that protect our cloud services and the customer data therein. To access some STP materials, you must log in as an authenticated user with your Microsoft cloud services account (either an Azure Active Directory organization account or a Microsoft Account) and review and accept the Microsoft Non-Disclosure Agreement for Compliance Materials.
