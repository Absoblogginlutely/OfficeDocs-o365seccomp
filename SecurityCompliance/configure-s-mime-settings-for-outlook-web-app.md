# Configure S/MIME settings for Outlook on the web

As an admin for Exchange Online, you can set up Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) to allow sending and receiving S/MIME-protected messages. Use the **Get-SmimeConfig** and **Set-SmimeConfig** cmdlets to view and manage this feature in Exchange Online PowerShell. To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=396554).
  
For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-SmimeConfig](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/4b29fa89-0840-4fe9-8885-019fcef2e02b.aspx) and [Set-SmimeConfig](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/de357ce0-8143-4c36-8032-026292fc63f0.aspx).
