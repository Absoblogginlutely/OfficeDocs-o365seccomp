# Configure S/MIME settings for Outlook Web App

As an organization administrator for both Exchange 2013 and Exchange Online, you can set up Outlook Web App to allow sending and receiving S/MIME-protected messages. Use the  `SMIMEConfig` cmdlet to manage this feature through the Exchange Management Shell interface. 
  
For more information such as a detailed description of parameters and examples for  `get-SMIMEConfig` and  `set-SMIMEConfig`, see the [Get-SmimeConfig](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/4b29fa89-0840-4fe9-8885-019fcef2e02b.aspx) and [Set-SmimeConfig](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/de357ce0-8143-4c36-8032-026292fc63f0.aspx) documentation. 
  
You can only use the Shell to perform this procedure. To learn how to open the Exchange Management Shell in your on-premises Exchange organization, see **Open the Shell**. To learn how to use Windows PowerShell to connect to Exchange Online, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=396554).
