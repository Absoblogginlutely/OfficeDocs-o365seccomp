# Close or delete a data investigation

fter you delete documents in the source content locations (mailboxes or sites), you will still have copies of these documents that you added to evidence as part of your investigation. To avoid further data spillage, you should consider deleting the investigation.

To delete an investigation:

1. On the **Settings** tab, click **Investigation information**.

2. Click  **Delete case**. 

If you don't need to delete the investigation or if you want to save the information that you collected during the investigation, you can click **Close case**. At a later date, you can re-open closed investigations.
