description: "Administrators can set up a native connector to import third-party data from  data sources such as Facebook Business pages, LinkedIn Company pages, and Instant Bloomberg. This lets you archive data from third-party data sources in Office 365 so you can use Office 365 compliance features such as legal hold, content search, and retention policies to manage the governance of your organization's third-party data.
