# Office 365 ATP Safe Links warning pages

[Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](office-365-atp.md) (ATP) helps protect your organization from phishing attempts and malware through features, such as [safe links](atp-safe-links.md), [safe attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md), and [anti-phishing protection](anti-phishing-protection.md). When protection is in place, links (URLs) in email messages and Office documents are checked. If a URL is identified as suspicious or malicious, you might be blocked from opening the URL when you click it. Instead of going directly to the site, you might see a warning page instead. 
  
Read this article to see [Examples of warning pages](atp-safe-links-warning-pages.md#examples) that might appear, along with [Recent updates to warning pages](atp-safe-links-warning-pages.md#updates).
