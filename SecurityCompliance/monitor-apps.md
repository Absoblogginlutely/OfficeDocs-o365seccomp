# Monitor and report app status in Microsoft 365 security

These reports provide more insight into how cloud apps are being used in your organization, including what kinds of apps, their level of risk, and alerts.

## Monitor email accounts at risk

Email protection shows email accounts at risk. You can click an account to investigate further in Windows Defender security center.

## Monitor app permissions granted by users

**Cloud App Security - OAuth apps** lists apps discovered by Cloud App Security that have been granted permissions by users. Cloud App Security's risk catalog includes over 16,000 apps that are assessed using over 70 risk factors.

The risk factors start from general information, such as the app publisher, to security measures and controls, such as whether the app supports for encryption at rest or provides an audit log of user activity.

## Monitor cloud app user accounts

**Cloud app accounts for review** lists accounts that may require attention.

## Understand which cloud apps are used

**Discovered cloud apps (categories)** show what kinds of apps are being used in your organization and links to the Cloud Discovery dashboard in Cloud App Security. For more information, see [Quickstart: Work with discovered apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/discovered-apps).  

## Monitor where users access cloud apps

**Cloud app activity locations** show where users are accessing cloud apps.

## Monitor health for infrastructure workloads
