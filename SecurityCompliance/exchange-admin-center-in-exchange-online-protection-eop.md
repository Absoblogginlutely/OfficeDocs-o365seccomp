## Accessing the EAC

In most cases, EOP customers will access the EAC through the Office 365 admin center. You can find a link to EOP in the drop-down menu in the **Admin** tile, which is next to the **Me** tile. Click the **Admin** tile and select **Exchange Online Protection** from the drop down menu to be taken to the EAC. 
  
You can also access the EAC sign in page directly via the following URL: https://admin.protection.outlook.com/ecp/\<companydomain\>. For example, https://admin.protection.outlook.com/ecp/contoso.onmicrosoft.com. After specifying your user credentials you will be taken directly into the EAC.
