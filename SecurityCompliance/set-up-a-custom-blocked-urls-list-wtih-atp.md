# Set up a custom blocked URLs list using Office 365 ATP Safe Links

With [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](office-365-atp.md) (ATP), your organization can have a custom list of website addresses (URLs) that are blocked. When a URL is blocked, people who click on links to the blocked URL are taken to a [warning page](atp-safe-links-warning-pages.md) that resembles the following image: 
  
![This site is blocked](media/6b4bda2d-a1e6-419e-8b10-588e83c3af3f.png)
  
The blocked URLs list is defined by your organization's Office 365 security team, and that list applies to everyone in the organization who is covered by Office 365 ATP Safe Links policies. 
  
Read this article to learn how to set up your organization's custom blocked URLs list for [ATP Safe Links in Office 365](atp-safe-links.md).
  
## View or edit a custom list of blocked URLs

[ATP Safe Links in Office 365](atp-safe-links.md) uses several lists, including your organization's custom blocked URLs list. If you have the necessary permissions, you can set up your organization's custom list. You do this by editing your organization's default Safe Links policy.
  
1. Go to [https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com) and sign in with your work or school account. 
    
2. In the left navigation, under **Threat management**, choose **Policy** \> **Safe Links**.
    
3. In the **Policies that apply to the entire organization** section, select **Default**, and then choose **Edit** (the Edit button resembles a pencil). 
    
    ![Click Edit to edit your default policy for Safe Links protection](media/d08f9615-d947-4033-813a-d310ec2c8cca.png)
  
    This is where you go to view your list of blocked URLs. Note that at first, you won't have any URLs listed.

4. Select the **Enter a valid URL** box, and then type a URL, and then choose the plus sign (+). Here are a few things to keep in mind: 
    
  - You can specify a domain-only URL (like `contoso.com` or `tailspintoys.com`). This will block clicks on any URL that contains the domain.
    
  - Do not include a forward slash ( **/**) at the end of the URL. For example, instead of entering `http://www.contoso.com/`, enter `http://www.contoso.com`.
    
  - You can include up to three wildcard asterisks (\*) per URL. The following table lists some examples of what you can enter and what effect those entries have.
    
|**Example Entry**|**What It Does**|
|:-----|:-----|
|`contoso.com` or `*contoso.com*`  <br/> |Blocks the domain, subdomains, and paths, such as `https://www.contoso.com`, `http://sub.contoso.com`, and `http://contoso.com/abc`  <br/> |
|`http://contoso.com/a`  <br/> |Blocks a site `http://contoso.com/a` but not additional subpaths like `http://contoso.com/a/b`  <br/> |
|`http://contoso.com/a*`  <br/> |Blocks a site `http://contoso.com/a` and additional subpaths like `http://contoso.com/a/b`  <br/> |
   
5. When you are finished adding URLs, in the lower right corner of the screen, choose **Save**.
    
## How to define exceptions for certain users in an organization

If you want certain groups to be able to view URLs that might be blocked for others, you can specify an ATP Safe Links policy that applies to specific recipients. See [Set up a custom "do not rewrite" URLs list using ATP Safe Links](set-up-a-custom-do-not-rewrite-urls-list-with-atp.md).
