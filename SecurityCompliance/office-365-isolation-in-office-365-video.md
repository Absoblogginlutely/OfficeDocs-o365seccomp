# Tenant Isolation in Office 365 Video
## Introduction
Azure Storage is used to store data for multiple Office 365 services, including Office 365 Video and Sway. Azure Storage includes Blob storage, which is a highly-scalable, REST-based, cloud object store that is used for storing unstructured data. Azure Storage uses a simple access control model; each Azure subscription can create one or more Storage Accounts. Each Storage Account has a single secret key that is used to control access to all data in that Storage Account. This supports the typical scenario where storage is associated with applications and those applications have full control over their associated data; for example, Sway storing content in Azure Storage. All customer content for Sway is stored in shared Azure storage accounts. Each user's content is in a separate directory tree of blobs in Azure storage.

The systems managing access to customer environments (e.g., the Azure Portal, SMAPI, etc.) are isolated within an Azure application operated by Microsoft. This logically separates the customer access infrastructure from the customer applications and storage layer.

## Tenant Isolation in Office 365 Video
[Office 365 Video](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Meet-Office-365-Video-ca1cc1a9-a615-46e1-b6a3-40dbd99939a6) is an enterprise portal that provides organizations with a highly secure, organization-wide destination for posting, sharing, and discovering video content. In Office 365 Video, each tenant's videos are kept isolated and encrypted in all locations, and are only available to authenticated users that have access and permissions to the organization's videos. Office 365 Video uses a combination of technologies to accomplish this:
- SharePoint Online is used for storing the video file and metadata (video title, description, etc.). It also provides the security and compliance layer (including authentication), and search features.
- Azure Media Services provides transcoding, adaptive streaming, secure delivery (using AES encryption), and thumbnail features.

[Azure Media Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/) is a platform-as-a-service offering for enabling end-to-end media workflows in the cloud. The platform provides a REST API for uploading, encoding, encrypting (with PlayReady), and delivery of media through Azure datacenters around the world.

All uploads for Office 365 Video occur via HTTPS. When a video file is uploaded, it is stored in SharePoint Online, and a copy of the file is sent via an encrypted channel to Azure Media Services. Azure Media Services transcodes the video into multiple formats that are optimized for viewing experience (e.g., mobile, low-bandwidth, high-bandwidth, etc.). These files, along with the original file acquired during upload, are stored in Azure Blob storage. The files are encrypted using AES 128 per the MPEG Common Encryption packaging algorithm (or an earlier PlayReady version) for playback, and encrypted using AES 256 storage encryption before being stored in Azure Blob storage. (Using the Azure Media Services Client SDK, customers can control which encryption is used. For example, a customer could apply Azure Media Services storage encryption (AES 256) to a high-value media asset before uploading it Azure Blob storage.)

Azure Media Services also generates a thumbnail for the video, which it transmits along with thumbnail metadata to SharePoint Online via an encrypted channel.
