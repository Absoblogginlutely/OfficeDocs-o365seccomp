# Use user spam notifications to release and report quarantined messages in Office 365

If your admin enables spam notifications for users, you'll receive a notification message that lists messages addressed to your mailbox that were identified as spam and quarantined instead.
  
> [!TIP]
> If you're an administrator and want to enable this feature, you can choose the option when you [modify a default anti-spam policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=800313). 
  
The message you receive includes the number of spam-quarantined messages you have, and the date and time (in Universal Coordinated Time or UTC) of the last message in the list. The list includes the following for each message:
  
- **Sender** The send name and email address of the quarantined message. 
    
- **Subject** The subject line text of the quarantined message. 
    
- **Date** The date and time (in UTC) that the message was quarantined. 
    
- **Size** The size of the message, in kilobytes (KBs). 
    
Currently, there are two actions you can take with a quarantined message:
  
- **Release to Inbox** Choose this to send the message to your inbox, where you can view it. 
    
- **Report as Not Junk** Choose this to send a copy of the message to Microsoft for analysis. The spam team evaluates and analyzes the message, and, depending on the results of the analysis, adjusts the anti-spam filter rules to allow the message through. 
    
Be aware of the following:
  
- Messages that are quarantined because they matched a mail flow rule are not included in user quarantined messages. Only spam-quarantined messages are listed.
    
- You can only release a message and report it as a false positive (not junk) once.
