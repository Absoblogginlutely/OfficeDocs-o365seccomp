# Monitor and report data

The Data category helps track user activity that could lead to unauthorized data disclosure. These are the rework of existing Office 365 DLP policy reports plus a 3rd party DLP policy match report. You can see:

* Users who share the most files from cloud apps
* How many DLP policy matches occurred
* How many DLP policies overrides or false positives are reported
* How many DLP policy matches happened in 3rd party cloud services via Microsoft Cloud App Security
