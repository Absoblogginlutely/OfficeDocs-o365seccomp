# Office 365 Management Activity API
Microsoft provides reporting services that enable administrators to obtain aggregated transactional information about their Office 365 tenant. The [Office 365 Management Activity API](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-apis-overview) uses an industry-standard RESTful design and OAuth v2 for authentication, which makes it easy to start experimenting with retrieving data and ingesting it into visualization tools and applications. The API provides a data feed that includes information about user, administrator, operations, and security activity in Office 365. The data can be kept for regulatory purposes, or combined with log data procured from an on-premises infrastructure or other sources to build a monitoring solution for operations, security, and compliance across the enterprise.

The Office 365 Management Activity API provides information about various user, admin, system, and policy actions and events from Office 365 and Azure Active Directory activity logs. The API provides a consistent audit schema with over 10 fields that are in common across all the services. This allows organizations to make easy connections between events, and it enables new ways to reason over the data. Dozens of Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) have partnered with Microsoft and built solutions based on the API. Some solutions are focused solely on Office 365 data, while others provide the ability to ingest data from multiple cloud providers and on-premises systems to create a unified view of all operations, security, and compliance-related activity. For more information, see the [Office 365 Management Activity API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference).
