# Information barriers

## Overview

Among the many powerful features included in Microsoft cloud services are communication and collaboration capabilities. But suppose that you want to restrict communications between two groups to avoid a conflict of interest from occurring in your organization. Information barriers, **coming soon to [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/information-barriers-in-teams)**, can help! Read this article to get an overview of information barriers, including what to expect, and next steps.

## How information barriers work

When information barriers are available in Microsoft Teams, your organization's security administrator or compliance administrator can define policies that limit communications between two groups of people within your organization. When information barrier policies are in effect, people in one group are not able to call people in the other group with Microsoft Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> Information barriers for Microsoft Teams will prevent people in one group from calling people in another group, as specified in your organization's policies. However, these policies will not apply to email communications or to file sharing through SharePoint Online, OneDrive, or Microsoft Teams.
