# Monitoring and Auditing Access Controls 

Microsoft performs extensive monitoring and auditing of all delegation, all use of privileges, and all operations that occur within Office 365. Office 365 access control is an automated process built on the principle of least privilege and to incorporate data access controls and audits:
- All permitted access is traceable to a unique user, making administrators accountable for their handling of customer content.
- Access control requests, approvals, and administrative operations logs are captured for analysis of security insights and malicious events.
- Access levels are reviewed in near real-time based on security group membership to ensure that only users who have authorized business justifications and meet the eligibility requirements have access to the systems.
- Office 365, its access controls, and supporting services, including Azure Active Directory and our physical datacenters, are regularly audited by independent third-parties for compliance with [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/iso-iec-27001), [ISO/IEC 27018](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/iso-iec-27018), [SOC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/SOC), [FedRAMP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/FedRAMP), and other [standards](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance?service=Office#Icons).
- Office 365 engineers are required to take yearly security training reviewing elevated access best practices and risks and acknowledge Microsoft's security and privacy policies to continue maintaining their entitlements to the service.

Automated alerts are triggered when suspicious activity is detected, such as multiple failed logins within a short period. The Office 365 Security Response team uses machine learning and big data analysis to review and analyze activity for irregular access patterns and to proactively respond to anomalous and illicit activities. Microsoft also employs a dedicated team of penetration testers and engages in periodic red team and blue team exercises to find security and access control issues in the service. Customers may also verify the effectiveness of access control systems by using audit reports and the management activity API provided by Office 365. For more information, see [Office 365 Management Activity API reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/mt227394.aspx) and [Auditing and Reporting in Office 365](http://aka.ms/Office365AR).
