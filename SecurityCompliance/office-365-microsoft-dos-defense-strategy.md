# Microsoft's Denial-of-Service Defense Strategy

Microsoft's strategy for defending against network-based denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is somewhat unique due to our scale and global footprint. This scale allows Microsoft to utilize strategies and techniques that few organizations (providers or customer organizations) can match. The cornerstone of our DoS strategy is leveraging our global presence. Microsoft engages with Internet providers, peering providers (public and private), and private corporations all over the world, giving us a significant Internet presence (which as of this writing, doubles around every 18 months). Having such a large presence enables Microsoft to absorb attacks across a very large surface area.

Given our unique nature, Microsoft uses detection and mitigation processes that differ from those used by large enterprises. Our strategy is based on a separation of detection and mitigation, as well as global, distributed mitigation through our many edges. Many enterprises use third-party solutions which detect and mitigate attacks at the edge. As our edge capacity grew, it became clear that the significance of any attack against individual or particular edges was very low. Because of our unique configuration, we have separated the detection and mitigation components. We have deployed multi-tiered detection that enables us to detect attacks closer to their saturation points while maintaining global mitigation at the edge. This strategy ensures we can handle multiple simultaneous attacks.

One of the most effective and low-cost defenses employed by Microsoft against DoS attacks is to reduce our attack surface. Doing so enables us to drop unwanted traffic at the edge, as opposed to analyzing, processing and scrubbing the data inline.

At the interface with the public network, Microsoft uses special-purpose security devices for firewall, network address translation, and IP filtering functions. We also use global equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing. Global ECMP routing is a network framework that ensures there are multiple global paths to reach a service. Thanks to these multiple paths, an attack against the service should be limited to the region from which the attack originates â€“ other regions should be unaffected by this attack, as end users would use other paths to reach the service in those regions. We have also developed our own internal DoS correlation and detection system that uses flow data, performance metrics and other information. This is a hyperscale cloud service running within Microsoft Azure which analyzes data collected from various points on Microsoft networks and services. A cross-workload DoS incident response team identifies the roles and responsibilities across teams, the criteria for escalations, and the protocols for engaging various teams and for incident handling. These solutions provide network-based protection against DoS attacks.

Finally, cloud-based workloads are configured with optimized thresholds based on their protocol and bandwidth usage needs to uniquely protect that workload.
