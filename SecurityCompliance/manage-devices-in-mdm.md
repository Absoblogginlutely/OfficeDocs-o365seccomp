# Manage devices enrolled in Mobile Device Management in Office 365

The built-in Mobile Device Management for Office 365 helps you secure and manage your users' mobile devices like iPhones, iPads, Androids, and Windows phones. The first step is to sign in to Office 365 and [set up MDM for Office 365](set-up-mobile-device-management.md). 
  
After you've set it up, the people in your organization must [enroll their devices](enroll-your-mobile-device.md) in the service. Then you can use MDM for Office 365 to help manage devices in your organization. For example, you can use device security policies to help limit email access or other services, view devices reports, and remotely wipe a device. You'll typically go to the [Go to the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://support.office.com/article/7e696a40-b86b-4a20-afcc-559218b7b1b8) to do these tasks. 
  
## Device management tasks

To get to the device management panel, follow these steps. 
  
1. Go to the Office 365 admin center.
    
2. Type Mobile Device Management into the search field, and select **Mobile Device Management** from the list of results.
