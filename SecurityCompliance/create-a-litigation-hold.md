# Create a Litigation Hold in Office 365

You can place a mailbox on Litigation Hold to retain all mailbox content, including deleted items and the original versions of modified items. When you place a user mailbox on Litigation Hold, content in the user's archive mailbox (if it's enabled) is also retained. When you create a hold, you can specify a hold duration (also called a *time-based hold*) so that deleted and modified items are retained for a specified period and then permanently deleted from the mailbox. Or you can just retain content indefinitely (called an *infinite hold*) or until the Litigation Hold is removed. If you do specify a hold duration period, it's calculated from the date a message is received or a mailbox item is created. 
  
Here's what happens when you create a Litigation Hold.
  
- Items that are permanently deleted by the user are retained in the Recoverable Items folder in the user's mailbox for the duration of the hold.
    
- Items that are purged from the Recoverable Items folder by the user are retained for the duration of the hold.
    
- The storage quota for the Recoverable Items folder is increased from 30 GB to 110 GB.
    
- Items in the user's primary and the archive mailboxes are retained
    
## Before you begin

- To place an Exchange Online mailbox on Litigation Hold, it must be assigned an Exchange Online Plan 2 license. If a mailbox is assigned an Exchange Online Plan 1 license, you would have to assign it a separate Exchange Online Archiving license to place it on hold.
