# SIEM integration with Office 365 Threat Intelligence

If your organization is using a security incident and event management (SIEM) server, you can integrate Office 365 Threat Intelligence with your SIEM server. This enables you to view information, such as malware detected by Office 365 Threat Intelligence, in your SIEM server reports.
  
## Use the Office 365 Activity Management API

To integrate Office 365 Threat Intelligence with your SIEM server, use the Office 365 Activity Management API. This API retrieves information about user, admin, system, and policy actions and events from your organization's Office 365 and Azure AD activity logs. 
  
You must be an Office 365 global administrator or have the security administrator role assigned in the Security &amp; Compliance Center.
  
See [Office 365 Management Activity API reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office-365/office-365-management-activity-api-reference).
