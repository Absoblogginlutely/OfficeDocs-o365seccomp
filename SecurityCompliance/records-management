# Records management in Office 365

Records management is all about keeping data around when you need it and getting rid of it when you don't. A well-designed records management program helps protect an organization legally, provides the ability to demonstrate compliance with regulatory obligations, and increases efficiency by promoting the disposition items that are no longer of value or no longer required to be retained by the organization. 

With records management in Office 365, you can apply your organization retention schedules into the file plan to manage retention, records declaration and disposition in support of the full content lifecycle and accross Office 365.

## Overview

A records management program typically includes the following elements:

  - Content analysis that identifies and categorizes content in the enterprise that can become records, that provides source locations, and that describes how the content will move to the records management application.

  - A file plan that indicates, for each kind of record in the enterprise, where they should be retained as records, the policies that apply to them, how long they must be retained, how they should be disposed of, and who is responsible for managing them.
  
  - A compliance requirements document that defines the rules that the organization tems must follow to ensure compliance and the methods that are used to ensure the participation of enterprise team members.
  
  - A method for collecting records that are no longer active from all record sources, such as collaboration servers, file servers, and email systems.

  - A method for auditing records while they are active.
  
  - A method for capturing records' metadata and audit histories and for maintaining them.
  
  - A process for holding records (suspending their disposition) when events such as litigations occur.
  
  - A system for monitoring and reporting on the handling of records to ensure that employees are filing, accessing, and managing them according to defined policies and processes.
  
  - A process and the data to support an auditable and defensible content and records lifecycle to provide to internal or external audit, legal and/or regulatory authorities for review.
