You'll see additional widgets, such as one showing your organization's cloud app compliance, and another showing data about users with shared files, with links to [Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/) or other tools where you can explore data.

## Protect

The **Protect** section contains widgets that provide you with high-level information about data loss prevention (DLP), third-party apps in use, shared files, shadow IT apps, and so on.
