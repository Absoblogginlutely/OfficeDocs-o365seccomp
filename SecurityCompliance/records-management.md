# Records management in Microsoft 365

Organizations of all types require a records-management to solution to manage business, legal, and HR records across their corporate data.  A well-designed records management plan helps protect an organization legally, provides the ability to demonstrate compliance with regulatory obligations, and increases efficiency by promoting the disposition of  items that are no longer of value or no longer required to be retained by the organization. 
 
A records management plan typically includes the following elements:
 
- **Content analysis** that identifies and categorizes content in the enterprise that are records, work in progress, or have business general use value. The analysis will also provide information about where the content resides, which business functions are custodians of the content, and how the content needs to be handled throughout its lifecycle.

- **Compliance requirements** that identify which regulations and laws are applicable, articulate the rules that the organization must follow to ensure compliance, and the methods that need to be used to ensure the participation of enterprise team members.

- **Operational and human resource requirements** that identify the authorities, stakeholders, and accountable parties within the organization that are required to act for the organization to be successful in complying with applicable laws and regulations and to meet the business-continuity goals of the records-management plan.

- **A file plan** to memorialize and systematize the final output and decisions made from the content analysis and compiled compliance requirements for each kind of record in the enterprise, equating to how they will be classified, where they will be retained, which policies apply, what events cause retention and deletion to begin or finish, how long they must be retained, how they will be disposed of, and who is responsible for managing them along the way.

- **A method for capturing content metadata and audit histories** and for maintaining them.

- **A process for holding records** (suspending their disposition) when events such as litigations occur.

- **A system for monitoring and reporting on compliance to the file plan** to ensure that employees are filing, accessing, and managing them according to defined policies and processes.

- **A process and the data to support an auditable and defensible content and records lifecycle** to provide to internal or external audit, legal and/or regulatory authorities for review.

With records management in Microsoft 365, you can incorporate your organization’s retention schedules into the file plan to manage retention, records declaration, and disposition in support of the full content lifecycle.
