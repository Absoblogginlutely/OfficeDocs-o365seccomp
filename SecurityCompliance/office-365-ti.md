## What's changing?

Formerly, Office 365 Threat investigation and responses capabilities were included in subscriptions, such as Office 365 Enterprise E5. This is still the case, and now these features are now part of Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2 (and this is included in Office 365 Enterprise E5). 

In addition, Office 365 Threat investigation and response capbailities were formerly available for purchase as an add-on for Office 365 for business customers. Now, these capabilities are included in Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2 (which also includes Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 1). To learn more, see [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection plans and pricing](https://products.office.com/exchange/advance-threat-protection).

Here's what all this means:

- **If your organization already has Office 365 Enterprise E5**, then you already have Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2, and this includes Threat investigation and response capabilities.

- **If your organization previously had Office 365 Threat Intelligence (but not Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection) as an add-on** to another Office 365 subscription, then you will have Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2. This includes Advanced Threat Protection Plan 1 and Threat investigation and response capabilities. 

- **If your organization previously had Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (but not Office 365 Threat Intelligence) as an add-on** to another Office 365 subscription, then you will have Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 1. This includes Advanced Threat Protection (but not Threat investigaiton and response capabilities).
