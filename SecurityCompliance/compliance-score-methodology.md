# Compliance Score Methodology

> [!NOTE]
> The Compliance Score does not express an absolute measure of organizational compliance with any particular standard or regulation. It expresses the extent to which you have adopted controls which can reduce the risks to personal data and individual privacy. No service can guarantee that you are compliant with a standard or regulation, and the Compliance Score should not be interpreted as a guarantee in any way.

The Compliance Manager dashboard displays a total compliance score for Assessments in each Assessment tile. This is the overall Compliance Score for the Assessment and is the accumulation of points received for each implemented and tested control in the Assessment. After adding a new Assessment, the Compliance Score has an initial value for the included Microsoft-managed controls tested by independent third parties.

The displayed Compliance Score values for the control are applied  *in their entirety*  to the Total Compliance Score on a pass/fail basis--either the control is implemented and passes the subsequent assessment test or it does not; there is no partial credit for a partial implementation. Only when the control has its **Implementation Status** set to **Implemented** or **Alternative Implementation** and the **Test Result** is set to **Passed** are the assigned points added to the Total Compliance Score. 
  
Most importantly, the Compliance Score can help you prioritize which controls to focus on for implementation by indicating which controls that have a higher potential risk if there is a failure related to a control. In addition to risk-based prioritization, it is worthwhile noting that where assessment controls are related to other controls (either within the same assessment or in another assessment that is in the same assessment grouping) completing a single control successfully can result in a significant reduction of effort based on the synchronization of control test results.
  
 ## Compliance score
  
In v3 of Compliance Manager, baseline scores move from the Control level to the Action level. Scores are based on an Actionâ€™s Purpose (Detective, Preventative, or Corrective) and Enforcement (Discretionary or Mandatory).

TABLE FOR DOC

Actions are mapped to Controls, and when a Control is mapped to multiple Actions, the sum of the Action Scores is the Control Score. The sum of the Control Score for all Controls in a given Assessment is the Assessment Score. The average score of all Assessments in a Group is the Compliance Score for that group.
  
 ### Mandatory or discretionary
  
 *Mandatory controls*  are controls that cannot be bypassed either intentionally or accidentally. An example of a common mandatory control is a centrally-managed password policy that sets requirements for password length, complexity, and expiration. Users must comply with these requirements in order to access the system. 
  
 *Discretionary controls*  rely upon users to understand policy and act accordingly. For example, a policy requiring users to lock their computer when they leave it is a discretionary control because it relies on the user. 
  
 ### Preventative, detective, or corrective
  
 *Preventative controls*  are those that prevent specific risks. For example, protecting information at rest using encryption is a preventative control against attacks, breaches, etc. Separation of duties is a preventative control to manage conflict of interest and to guard against fraud. 
  
 *Detective controls*  are those that actively monitor systems to identify irregular conditions or behaviors that represent risk or that can be used to detect intrusions or determine if a breach has occurred. System access auditing and privileged administrative actions auditing are types of detective monitoring controls; regulatory compliance audits are a type of detective control used to find process issues. 
  
 *Corrective controls*  are those that try to keep the adverse effects of a security incident to a minimum, take corrective action to reduce the immediate effect, and reverse the damage, if possible. Privacy incident response is a corrective control to limit damage and restore systems to an operational state after a breach. 
  
By evaluating each control using these factors, we determine the essence of the control and assign it a value relative to the risk that it represents.
  
 
  
Here's the basic workflow for a typical Action:
  
1. The Compliance, Risk, Privacy, and/or Data Protection Officer of an organization assigns the task to someone in the organization to implement a control. That person could be:

    - A business policy owner
    
    - An IT implementer
    
    - Another individual in the organization who has responsibility for performing the task
    
2. That individual performs the tasks necessary to implement the control, uploads evidence of implementation into Compliance Manager, and marks the control(s) tied to the Action as implemented. Once these tasks are completed, they assign the Action to an Assessor for validation. Assessors can be:
    
    - Internal assessors that perform validation of controls within an organization
    
    - External assessors that examine, verify, and certify compliance, such as the third-party independent organizations that audit Microsoft's cloud services
    
3. The Assessor validates the control and examines the evidence and marks the control(s) as assessed and the results of the assessment (e.g., passed.
    
Once all the controls associated with an Assessment have been assessed, the Assessment is considered completed.
