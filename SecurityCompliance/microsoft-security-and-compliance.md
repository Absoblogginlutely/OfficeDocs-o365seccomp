You’ll have easy access to sensitivity and retention labels and policies, data loss prevention (DLP), data governance, eDiscovery, data subject requests (DSRs), case management, and Cloud App Security. Additionally, you can gain actionable insights and leverage intelligent automation to reduce your compliance risks and safeguard your digital estate.

## What to expect

### Coming soon!

The new Microsoft 365 security center and the new Microsoft 365 compliance center are rolling out beginning late January and through March 2019. You should have access to the new Microsoft 365 security center and Microsoft 365 compliance center within this timeframe.

### Easy access!

With improved navigation, integrated solutions, and a streamlined experience, you'll be able to see and access the information you're most interested in and take advantage of the powerful security and compliance solutions in Microsoft 365.

### Smooth transition!

You can expect a smooth transition to the new centers. After this change is fully rolled out, we plan to retire the former Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.microsoft.com](https://protection.microsoft.com)). The administrator experience will change, but this won’t impact your current security and compliance configurations.

After this update is rolled out, if your organization has Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3 or E5, your security and compliance administrators can:

- Navigate directly to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com); <br>or  
- Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center, and then navigate to the new Microsoft 365 security center and Microsoft 365 compliance center (links are under Admin Centers in the left navigation pane).

> [!TIP]
> If you are using the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](http://protection.office.com)), you will still be able to configure and manage your Office 365 settings within your existing Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. Configurations will be maintained in the existing Office 365 Security & Compliance Center as well as in the new Microsoft 365 security center and Microsoft 365 compliance center.  

## Required licenses and permissions
