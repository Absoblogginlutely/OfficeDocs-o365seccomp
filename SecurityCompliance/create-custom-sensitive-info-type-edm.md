# Create a custom sensitive information type for DLP with Exact Data Match (EDM) (Preview)

## Overview

Read this article to create a [custom sensitive information type](custom-sensitive-info-types.md) using Exact Data Match (EDM) classification. (NOTE: This feature is currently in preview.) 

With EDM capabilities, you can define DLP policies that detect sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, employee identification numbers, patient record details, and more, by looking for specific data values in a database. 

## Required licenses and permissions

During the preview program, you can try EDM if your organization has Office 365 Enterprise E3 or Office 365 Enterprise E5.

When EDM is released, your organization must have Office 365 Enterprise E5.

You must be a global admin, compliance administrator, or Exchange Online administrator to perform the tasks described in this article

## Other methods to create a custom sensitive information type

EDM isn't the only way to create custom sensitive information types. You can also use PowerShell and the Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com)). To learn more about those methods, see:
