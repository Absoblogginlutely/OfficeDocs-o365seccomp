# Privacy and security for built-in mobile device management for Office 365

Mobile Device Management for Office 365 is a cloud-based service, powered by Microsoft Intune, that helps you manage and secure mobile devices used in your organization. For example, after you activate the MDM for Office 365 service, you can create mobile device management policies in the Security &amp; Compliance Center. These policies can then be deployed to mobile devices that have been enrolled by licensed Office 365 users in your organization.
  
Microsoft Intune will send information to Office 365 about the compliance status of each managed device, and then from the Security &amp; Compliance Center, you can generate reports that show whether managed devices in your organization are compliant based upon policies that were set. To learn more about Microsoft's commitment to the privacy and security of this MDM service, see the [Microsoft Intune Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/intune-trust-center/overview.aspx).
