# Use Threat Explorer in the Security &amp; Compliance Center

If your organization has [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2](office-365-ti.md), and you have the necessary permissions, you can use Threat Explorer to identify and analyze threats. For example, you can identify and delete malicious email that was delivered, or see malware that was caught by Office 365 security features. Threat Explorer (also referred to as Explorer) is a powerful near real-time tool to help Security Operations teams investigate and respond to threats in the Security &amp; Compliance Center.

To use Explorer, in the Security &amp; Compliance Center, go to **Threat management** \> **Explorer**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Office 365 Threat Intelligence is now Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2, along with additional threat protection capabilities. To learn more, see [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection plans and pricing](https://products.office.com/exchange/advance-threat-protection) and the [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Service Description](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description).
      
## Explorer overview

If your organization has [Office 365 Threat investigation and response capabilities](office-365-ti.md) (this is included in ATP Plan 2), and you have the necessary permissions, you can use Threat Explorer (also referred to as Explorer) to identify and analyze threats. (In the Security &amp; Compliance Center, go to **Threat management** \> **Explorer**.)

![Go to Threat management \> Explorer](media/cab32fa2-66f1-4ad5-bc1d-2bac4dbeb48c.png)

This article describes a few things you can do with Explorer (there are many more possibilities):

- [See what kinds of malware were detected in email](#see-malware-detected-in-email-by-technology), and by threat protection technology (anti-malware protection, ATP Safe Attachments, etc.)

- [View data about phishing links (URLs)](#view-data-about-phishing-urls-and-click-verdict), and what the click verdicts were (URLs blocked, allowed, or visited despite warnings)

- [Review email messages that were reported as Junk, Not Junk, or Phishing](#review-email-messages-reported-by-users), and identify any trends (such as a larger than usual number of messages reported as Phish) 

## See malware detected in email by technology

Suppose you want to see malware that was detected in email, and by what technology in Office 365. To do this, use the [Email > Malware](threat-explorer-views.md#email--malware) view of Explorer.

1. In the Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com)), choose **Threat management** > **Explorer**.
2. In the **View** menu, choose **Email** > **Malware**.<br/>![View menu for Explorer](media/ExplorerViewEmailMalwareMenu.png)<br/>
3. Click **Sender**, and then choose **Basic** > **Detection technology**.<br/>Your detection technologies are now available as filters for the report.<br/>![Malware detection technologies](media/ExplorerEmailMalwareDetectionTech.png)<br/> 
4. Select an option, and then click the Refresh button to apply that filter.<br/>![Selected detection technology](media/ExplorerEmailMalwareDetectionTechATP.png)<br/> 

The report refreshes to show the results malware detected in email, using the technology option you selected. From here, you can conduct further analysis.

## View data about phishing URLs and click verdict

Suppose you want to see phishing attempts through URLs in email, including a list of URLs that were allowed, blocked, and overridden. To do this, use the [Email > Phish](threat-explorer-views.md#email--phish) view of Explorer.

1. In the Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com)), choose **Threat management** > **Explorer**.
2. In the **View** menu, choose **Email** > **Phish**.<br/>![View menu for Explorer](media/ExplorerViewEmailPhishMenu.png)<br/>
3. Click **Sender**, and then choose **URLs** > **Click verdict**.
4. Select one or more options, such as **Blocked** and **Block overridden**, and then click the **Refresh** button to apply that filter.<br/>![URLs and click verdicts](media/ThreatExplorerEmailPhishClickVerdictOptions.png)<br/>

The report refreshes to show detected phishing URLs in email that were blocked (or visited despite a warning), along with email delivery status. From here, you can conduct further analysis. For example, below the chart, you can see the top URLs that were blocked in your organization's email.

## Review email messages reported by users

Suppose you want to see email messages that users in your organization have reported as Junk, Not Junk, or Phishing by using the [Report Message add-in for Outlook and Outlook on the web](enable-the-report-message-add-in.md). To do this, use the [Email > User-reported](threat-explorer-views.md#email--user-reported) view of Explorer.

The report refreshes to show data about email messages that people in your organization have reported as a phishing attempt. You can use this information to conduct further analysis, and if necessary, adjust your [ATP anti-phishing policies](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md).
