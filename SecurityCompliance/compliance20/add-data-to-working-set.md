# Add search results to a working set

After you've identified and culled with searches against Exchange, SharePoint and OneDrive for business, you can add the results to a working set. Working sets represent a static set of documents that we will index for lightning fast search results, analyze for email thread identification, near duplicate detection and themes.  You can also add data from Non-Office 365 data sources to live side by side with the data you collect from Office 365.

To add data to a working set, start by selecting a search, in the search results fly out, click the *+ Add results to working set* button.

You can then choose to add to an existing working set or a *New working set*.  If adding to a new working set, specify the name and finally click the *Add* button.

Adding data to a working set is a long running process, you can either track the progress in the Jobs tab or in the *Working set status* column in the *Searches* tab.  The process includes gathering items from Office 365 and finally Ingestion & Indexing.  Once working set processing is completed, you can navigate to the working set by clicking on the *Working Sets* tab and then clicking on the working set.  You can then move on to searching, reviewing, tagging and exporting any relevant data.
