# Export case data in Advanced eDiscovery (Preview)

Exporting is accomplished within a working set in order to provide full visibility into what is being exported from a tenant. There are three separate methods to export content:

Download – allows a user to download a small set of native files via the browser.

Export – customize export to include additional content including a metadata file, burned in redacted files and text files.

Working Set – allows a user to export content from one working set to another working set.

Once export is complete, the content is placed in a Microsoft Azure blob. The content can be reached by using the information in the Exports tab. For more information, see \[link to download export jobs\]
