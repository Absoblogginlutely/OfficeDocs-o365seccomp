# Export case data in Advanced eDiscovery (Preview)

There are three ways to export data from a working set:

**Download** – Use to download (by using a browser) a small set of native files. This is the quickest was to export a small set of data.

**Export** – Use to customize what data is exported, including the export of metadata files, native files, text files, and redacted documents that have been saved to a PDF file. After exported data is uploaded Azure storage location, you have to download it to a local computer. For more information, see: 

   - [Export documents from a working set](export-documents-from-working-set.md)

   - [Download export jobs](download-export-jobs.md)

**Add to another working set** – Use to copy data from one working set to a different working set. For more information, see [Add data from one working set to another working set](add-data-to-working-set-from-another-working-set.md).
