# eDiscovery in the Microsoft cloud

It can happen in any organization. You’re going about your day-to-day business, and you receive a discovery request for *any and all* information (email, documents, presentations, instant messages, images, voice mail, social media posts, and so on) related to a project you completed last year. Or you need to collect data that demonstrates you’re complying with corporate or government rules. For Office 365 organizations in the Microsoft cloud, the tools required to manage those tasks are built into the same platform where the data is.

To be prepared for internal investigations, external litigation, or regulatory requests, your organization needs to identify, preserve, and collect data potentially relevant data.


## Key benefits of eDiscovery in the Microsoft Cloud

As organizations migrate to the cloud, they need solutions designed for the cloud from the start, not simply older tools that have been shoe-horned into this new environment. That's why our cloud first strategy requires that we build new solutions that give our customers increased efficiencies, cost savings, and security in the cloud. eDiscovery has traditionally been performed on-premises where information is manually collected from various sources and processed to find the most relevant data. The Advanced eDiscovery solution in the Microsoft cloud offers eDiscovery a scalable, efficient, up to date, and provides a secure environment for the entire eDiscovery workflow.

eDiscovery in the Microsoft cloud provides many benefits, including:

- **Global availability** - The Microsoft eDiscovery solution is available globally to use in any locale or situation where you need to find and access content to respond to legal and compliance needs or to an internal investigation

- **Cost savings** - Advanced eDiscovery helps you identify the most relevant content more quickly and easily, with far less manual review than previously possible. In legal matters, with less content to send to third-party reviewers, review costs are significantly reduced.

- **Faster responses to eDiscovery requests** - Content that you place on hold in the Microsoft cloud is preserved and indexed in place. You don’t need to move it to another archive for preservation and then wait for it to be indexed before you can search it. Advanced eDiscovery lets you quickly identify and export relevant content when you need it.

- **Less manual work** - Enhanced remediation in Advanced eDiscovery reduces the need to manually remediate unsearchable content. Also, the ability to port relevant content directly into third-party review tools eliminates the need for manual processing to enable ingestion.

## Data governance, eDiscovery, and audting in the Microsoft cloud

Managing information effectively to meet internal and external compliance requirements is more difficult than ever. The solution starts with effective information governance. In Office 365, we deliver cloud-powered, intelligent, in-place information governance solutions that address importing, retaining, protecting, and purging files when a scheduled expiration date occurs. These solutions help you keep important information; delete what’s redundant, obsolete, or trivial; and manage how sensitive or confidential information is shared. The high-value, important content in your organization can be protected for as long as you need it.

The information governance features in the Microsoft cloud help you intelligently manage content in a proactive manner to respond to internal and external compliance requirements. You can respond to eDiscovery requests more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively. The Security & Compliance Center is a central location where you manage data governance and eDiscovery across all of your organization's data stored in Office 365 data assets. The data governance workflow in the Microsoft cloud allows you to:

- **Import content into Office 365 so that you can manage it** - For on-premises content stored in Exchange or file shares, Office 365 provides an import service. For external content from social and messaging apps, document collaboration tools, and vertical apps (such as CRM or financial sites), some Microsoft partners provide connectors that support different third-party file formats. Additionally, Microsoft is working to provide connectors so the you can import third-party data directly.

- **Manage data governance** - Data governance features in the Microsoft cloud helps ensure that content is managed in a way that supports your compliance needs. It lets you proactively set retention policies on your Office 365 content in mailboxes, SharePoint sites, OneDrive for Business account, Microsoft Teams, Skype for Business conversations, Office 365 groups, and other content locations in the Microsoft cloud. You can retain important content and delete content when you no longer need it. For specific investigations, you can preserve just the content associated with custodians in an Advanced eDiscovery case by putting the content on hold. For records management, you can create and publish retention labels so that users in your organization can classify important content.
 
- **Create and manage Advanced eDiscovery cases** - Advanced eDiscovery cases facilitate investigations and restrict access to them. When you create a case, you can manage it as follows: add members and give them specific permissions to control the types of actions they can perform in an investigation; place content source locations associated with the case on hold; preserve on-hold content indefinitely, until you remove the hold, without saving content to a separate archive; specify a date range and keywords to narrow the content that’s preserved; run broad or targeted queries; prepare content for deeper processing and analytics with Advanced eDiscovery; and export content for review and production.

- **Preserve content in place** -  When you place a hold on content, it remains in place, where ever it’s located in the Microsoft cloud, so that custodians (the creaters or owners of the content) can continue to access and manage it. Content such as email messages, chat conversations, calendar items, and files that are stored in Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams—remains accessible to custodians, without duplication or stubbing. When you preserve content in the Microsoft cloud, it’s preserved in an immutable form. If someone modifies or deletes content that's on hold content, the system preserves the original version in a secure location. Office 365 preserves only the content that the policy or custodian has tried to delete, so there’s no duplication. It saves one definitive copy, and you don’t use additional disk space for extra copies. 

- **Run simple or complex search queries to collect case data** - The search functionality in Advanced eDiscovery lets you query all of your organization’s Office 365 content, or focus searches on particular content locations used by custodians in a specific case. To search efficiently, you don’t need to copy your content to a consolidated external repository. You can search all Exchange Online mailboxes, all SharePoint Online sites, all OneDrive for Business accounts, all Microsoft Teams, and all Office 365 groups source locations in a single search. Additionally, you use keyword queries and search conditions to help narrow the search results to what is most relevant for a case.

- **Quickly analyze content for relevance** - Advanced eDiscovery helps you analyze large data sets and find content that’s most relevant to a case. It can also organize the case data, making the legal review process easier and more efficient.

- **Export content for review** - You can export files from Advanced eDiscovery cases in their native format. Advanced eDiscovery additionally exports content in a format that third-party review applications can directly ingest.
	
- **Audit activities in Office 365** You can monitor security and bolster the defensibility of your eDiscovery results by logging user and administrator activity in Microsoft services such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft teams. Log files are stored for 90 days (or 365 days for E5 organizations). For longer term storage, download the log files using the Management Activity API. View reports in Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, or create custom reports by using the Management Activity API.
