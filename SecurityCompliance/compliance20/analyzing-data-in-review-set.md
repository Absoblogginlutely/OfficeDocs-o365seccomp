# Analyze data in a working set in Advanced eDiscovery (Preview)

When the number of collected documents is large, it can be quite difficult to review them all. Advanced eDiscovery (Preview) provides a number of tools to analyze the documents to reduce the volume of documents to be reviewed without any loss in information, and to help you organize the documents in a coherent manner. To learn more about these capabilities, see:

- [Near duplicate detection](near-duplicates.md)
- [Email threading](email-threading.md)
- [Themes](themes.md)

To analyze data in a working set:

1. Configure analytics settings for your case. For more information, see [Configure search and analytics settings](configure-search-analytics-settings.md).
2. Open the working set you wish to analyze.
3. Go to "Manage working set".
4. Click "Analyze".

You can check the progress of analysis in the Jobs tab in your case.

 Once analysis is completed, you can view analytics report, run queries within your working set on outputs of the analysis (for more information see [Query within your working set](working-set-search.md)), and see related documents of a given document (for more information see [Reviewing data in working set](reviewing-data-in-review-set.md)).

## Analytics report

To view a analytics report for your working set:

1. Open your working set.
2. Go to "Manage working set".
3. Click "Report".

The report has four components from analysis:

- **Breakdown** - How many emails, attachments, and loose documents were found in the working set.

- **Documents (excluding attachments)** - How many loose documents were pivots, unique near duplicates of a pivot, or an exact duplicate of another document.

- **Emails** - How many emails were inclusives, inclusive copies, inclusive minuses, or none of the above.

- **Attachments** - How many email attachments were unique or duplicates of a different email attachment within the working set.
