# Fixing processing errors in Advanced eDiscovery

Processing is the process of file identification, expansion of embedded documents and attachments, text extraction, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of image files and indexing of that content.  When a custodian is placed on hold, all partially indexed items from Office 365 are processed to make them fully searchable.  Likewise, when content is added to a working set from Office 365 data sources or non-Office 365 data sources, the content is also processed.

The **Processing** tab in Advanced eDiscovery provides transparency into the status of Advanced Indexing for all of these scenarios.

See the following topics for more details.
