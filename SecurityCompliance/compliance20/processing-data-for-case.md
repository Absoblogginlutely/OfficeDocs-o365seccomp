# Processing data for a case in eDiscovery 2.0

Processing is the process of file identification, expansion of embedded documents and attachments, text extraction, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of image files and indexing of that content.  When a custodian is placed on hold, all partially indexed items from Office 365 are processed to make them fully searchable.  Likewise, when content is added to a working set from Office 365 or Non-Office 365 is added to a working set, the content is also processed.

The processing tab in Advanced eDiscovery provides transparancy into the status of Advanced Indexing for all of these scenarios.

See the following topics for more details.
