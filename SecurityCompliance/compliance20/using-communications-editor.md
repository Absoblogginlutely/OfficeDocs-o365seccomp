# Use the communications editor
As you define the content of your portal content, legal hold notifications, and related reminders/escalations, you can leverage the Communications Editor to format and dynamically customize your content.

## Rich-Text Editor 

The Communications Editor allows user to customize the text using the editor options. For example, users can change font types, create bulleted lists, highlight content, and more. 

## Merge Field Variables

You can leverage email merge variables from the Communications Editor to embed customized custodian attributes into a communication's body text. When sent to the custodian, the merge field will be populated with the corresponding field. For example, when sent to custodian John Smith, the merge field [Custodian Name] would be translated with the corresponding name. 

You can use email merge fields by selecting the **Merge Field** icons on the top of the rich-text editor control. The placeholder will be added based off the location of the users' cursor.
