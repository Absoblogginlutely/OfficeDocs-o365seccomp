# Collecting data for a case in Advanced eDiscovery

Once you have identified custodians and data sources that are of interest for your case, it is time to identify the set(s) of documents to delve into. You can use Workload Search to identify these from custodial and non-custodial locations in Office 365.

After you run a search, you will be able to view statistics on the retrieved items such as which locations had the most matched item. You can also preview a subset of the results. Once you are sure of the set of documents you would like to further examine, you can add the search to a working set to collect and process.

## Create search
"New search" will start a wizard that guides you through creating a search. For detailed information on how to create a search, please refer to [Create a search to collect data](create-search-to-collect-data.md).

Once the search is created, you will see a flyout with details. Note that the "Statistics" button and the "Preview" button are grayed out at first because the search has not completed yet. You can keep track of the progress of your search in the list of searches.

## View results
There are two components of a workload search: Statistics (Estimates) and Preview. As each of these components complete, you will see the corresponding columns for your search go from "Submitted" to "In Progress" to "Completed".

Once "Estimates" is completed, when you click on the search the details flyout will include some high-level statistics on the results. You will also see that the "Statistics" button is now active. You can click on the button to see statistics around the search, such as:

- Summary
- Top locations
- Queries
- Refiners

For more information on the available statistics, please refer to [Search statistics](search-statistics.md).

Once "Preview" is completed, you will see the "Preview" button is now active. You can click on the button to preview a sampled subset of the results.

## Add to working set
Once you are ready to collect and process the entire results of a search, you can do so by adding it to a working set. For details, see [Add data to a working set](add-data-to-working-set.md).
