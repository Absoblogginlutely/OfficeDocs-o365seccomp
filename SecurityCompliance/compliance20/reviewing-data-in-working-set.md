## File metadata

This panel can be toggled on/off to display various metadata associated with the document. Although the search results grid can be customized to display specific metadata, there are instances where scrolling horizontally can be difficult while reviewing data. The File metadata panel allows a user to toggle on a view within the viewer.

## Native View

The Native viewer displays the richest view of a document. It supports hundreds of file types and is meant to display the truest to native experience possible. For Microsoft Office files, for example, the viewer leverages Office Online in order to display content such as document comments, Excel formulas, hidden rows/columns, PowerPoint notes, etc. For more information regarding the Office Online viewers, visit here \[need link\]
