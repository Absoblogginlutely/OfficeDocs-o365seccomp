# Work with custodians in Advanced eDiscovery (Preview)

Often, when an organization is responding to a legal investigation, the workflow around identifying, preserving, and collecting potentially relevant content is based off people or data custodians within their organization. In eDiscovery, these individuals are called data custodians and are defined as “persons having administrative control of a document or electronic file”. For example, the data custodian of an email could be the owner of the mailbox which contains the relevant message.  

When an investigation begins, the eDiscovery team must quickly identify all the relevant custodians and data sources related to the case. Over time, the lists of custodians and their data sources may expand or contract. As a result, organizations must maintain a controlled process around identifying, preserving, and collecting custodial content throughout the lifecycle of a case.

Within an Advanced eDiscovery (Preview) case, legal teams can add individuals within their organization as data custodians and automatically identify and preserve custodial sources such as Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams sites. By using the built-in and in-place Custodian Management tool, organizations can secure electronically stored information (ESI) from inadvertent deletion and say goodbye to manual, time consuming, and error-prone legal hold processes. 

For more information about working with custodians, see the following articles:
