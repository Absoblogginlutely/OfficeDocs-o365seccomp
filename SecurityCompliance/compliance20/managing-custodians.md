# Work with custodians in Advanced eDiscovery (Preview)

When an organization is responding to a legal investigation, the workflow around identifying, preserving, and collecting potentially relevant content is based off people or data custodians within their organization. In eDiscovery, these individuals are called *data custodians* (or just *custodians*) and are defined as "persons having administrative control of a document or electronic file. For example, the custodian of an email message could be the owner of the mailbox which contains the relevant message.  

When an investigation begins, the eDiscovery team must quickly identify all the relevant custodians and data sources related to the case. Over time, the list of custodians and their data sources may increase or decreasse. As a result, organizations must maintain a controlled process around identifying, preserving, and collecting custodial content throughout the life cycle of a case.

Within an Advanced eDiscovery (Preview) case, legal teams can add individuals in their organization as custodians and automatically identify and preserve custodial data sources such as Exchange mailboxes, OneDrive accounts, and SharePoint and Teams sites. By using the built-in custodian management tool in Advanced eDiscovery (Preview), organizations can secure electronically stored information from inadvertent (or intentional) deletion and say goodbye to manual, time consuming, and error-prone legal hold processes. 

For more information about working with custodians, see the following articles:

- [Manage custodians in a case](manage-new-custodians.md)
