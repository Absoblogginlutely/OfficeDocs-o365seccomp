# Create a new case in eDiscovery 2.0

Using Advanced eDiscovery in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, you can manage custodians, find, retain and review information needed in legal investigations. In an Advanced eDiscovery case, you can add members who can access the case, control what types of actions that specific case members can perform, search for and place a legal hold on content locations relevant to a legal case. You can also create static copies of gathered content to review, annotate and export.

Below is recommended workflow to set up and use Advanced eDiscovery cases in the Security & Compliance Center.
