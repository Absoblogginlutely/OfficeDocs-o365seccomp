# Prevent data loss in Office 365

With a data loss prevention (DLP) policy, you can identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information across Office 365. For example, you can help prevent sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or health records from inadvertently leaking outside your organization.
  
## Learn about DLP

Get an overview of DLP, including its capabilities, how it works, and how you can use it to help protect sensitive information. 
  
- [Overview of data loss prevention policies](data-loss-prevention-policies.md)
    
- [Watch an extended overview of DLP](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=852300)
    
## Set up DLP

You create DLP policies in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center.

## Understand the sensitive information types

Use these topics to understand exactly what DLP looks for when it identifies sensitive information. You can also use this information to help you customize an existing sensitive information type or create a new custom one.

## Customize the sensitive information types

DLP includes many built-in sensitive information types that are ready for you to use, such as credit card numbers or bank account numbers. You can customize these built-in types by copying and modifying the XML file. And if you need to identify and protect a different type of sensitive information - for example, an employee ID that uses a format specific to your organization - you can create a custom sensitive information type.

## Extend DLP

Data about DLP events is provided by the Office 365 Management Activity API. This auditing data includes events such as what rule and policy was matched, what type of sensitive information was detected, and what actions were taken. After you grant permission, this data can be used by a third-party application.
