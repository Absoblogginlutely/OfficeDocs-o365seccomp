# Archive Instant Bloomberg data in Office 365 (Preview)

The connector feature to archive Instant Bloomberg data in Office 365 is in Preview.

Use a native connector in the Security & Compliance Center in Office 365 to import and archive chat data from Instant Bloomberg. After you set up and configure a connector, it connects to your organization's Instant Bloomberg account (on a scheduled basis), converts the content of chat messages to an email message format, and then imports those items mailboxes in Office 365.

After Twitter data is imported, you can apply Office 365 compliance features such as Litigation Hold, Content Search, In-Place Archiving, Auditing, Supervision, and Office 365 retention policies to the data stored in the mailbox. For example,you can search third-party data using Content Search or associate it with a custodian in an Advanced eDiscovery case. Using sample connectors to import and archive Twitter data in Office 365 can help your organization stay compliant with government and regulatory policies.
