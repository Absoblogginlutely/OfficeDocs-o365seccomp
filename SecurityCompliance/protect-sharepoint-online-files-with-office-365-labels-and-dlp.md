# Protect SharePoint Online files with Office 365 labels and DLP

 **Summary:** Apply Office 365 labels and data loss prevention (DLP) policies for SharePoint Online team sites with various levels of information protection.
  
Use the steps in this article to design and deploy Office 365 labels and DLP policies for baseline, sensitive, and highly confidential SharePoint Online team sites. For more information about these three tiers of protection, see [Secure SharePoint Online sites and files](secure-sharepoint-online-sites-and-files.md).
  
## How this works
1. Create the desired labels and publish these. It can take up to 12 hours for these to be published.
2. For the desired SharePoint sites, edit the document library settings to apply a label to items in the library.
3. Create DLP policies to take action based on the labels.

When users add a document to the library, the document will receive the assigned label by default. Users can change the label, if needed. When a user shares a document outside the organization, DLP will check to see if a label is assigned and take action if a DLP policy matches the label. DLP will look for other policy matches as well, such as protecting files with credit card numbers if this type of policy is configured. 

## Office 365 labels for your SharePoint Online sites

There are three phases to creating and then assigning Office 365 labels to SharePoint Online team sites.
  
### Phase 1: Determine the Office 365 label names

In this phase, you determine the names of your Office 365 labels for the four levels of information protection applied to SharePoint Online team sites. The following table lists the recommended names for each level.
  
|**SharePoint Online team site protection level**|**Label name**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Baseline-Public  <br/> |Internal public  <br/> |
|Baseline-Private  <br/> |Private  <br/> |
|Sensitive  <br/> |Sensitive  <br/> |
|Highly Confidential  <br/> |Highly Confidential  <br/> |
   
### Phase 2: Create the Office 365 labels

In this phase, you create and then publish your determined labels for the different levels of information protection.
  
To create the labels, you can use the Microsoft 365 admin center or Microsoft PowerShell.
  
### Create Office 365 labels with the Microsoft 365 admin center

1. Sign in to the admin center with an account that has the Security Administrator or Company Administrator role. For help, see [Where to sign in to Office 365](https://support.office.com/Article/Where-to-sign-in-to-Office-365-e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4).
    
2. From the **Microsoft Office Home** tab, click the **Admin** tile.
    
3. From the new **Office Admin center** tab of your browser, click **Admin centers > Security &amp; Compliance**.
    
4. From the new **Home - Security &amp; Compliance** tab of your browser, click **Classifications > Labels**.
    
5. From the **Home > Labels** pane, click the **Retention** tab, and then click **Create a label**.
    
6. On the **Name your label** pane, type the name of the label and a description for admins and users, and then click **Next**.

7. On the **Label settings** pane, click **Next**.
    
8. On the **Review your settings** pane, click **Create**, and then click **Close**.
    
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for your additional labels.
    
### Create Office 365 labels with PowerShell

1. [Connect to the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center using remote PowerShell](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=799771&amp;clcid=0x409) and specify the credentials of an account that has the Security Administrator or Company Administrator role.
    
2. Fill out the list of label names, and then run these commands at the PowerShell command prompt:
    
  ```
  $labelNames=@(<list of label names, each enclosed in quotes and separated by commas>)
ForEach ($element in $labelNames){ New-ComplianceTag -Name $element }
  ```

### Publish your new labels

Next, use these steps to publish the new Office 365 labels.
  
1. From the **Home > Labels** pane of the Security &amp; Compliance Center, click the **Retention** tab, and then click **Publish labels**.
    
2. On the **Choose labels to publish** pane, click **Choose labels to publish**.
    
3. On the **Choose labels** pane, click **Add** and select all four labels.
    
4. Click **Done**.
    
5. On the **Choose labels to publish** pane, click **Next**.
    
6. On the **Choose locations** pane, click **Next**.
    
7. On the **Name your policy** pane, type a name for your set of labels in **Name**, and then click **Next**.
    
8. On the **Review your settings** pane, click **Publish labels**, and then click **Close**.

    
### Phase 3: Apply the Office 365 labels to your SharePoint Online sites

Use these steps to apply the Office 365 labels to the documents folders of your SharePoint Online team sites.
  
1. From the **Microsoft Office Home** tab of your browser, click the **SharePoint** tile.
    
2. On the new **SharePoint** tab in your browser, click a site that needs an Office 365 label assigned.
    
3. In the new SharePoint site tab of your browser, click **Documents**.
    
4. Click the settings icon, and then click **Library settings**.
    
5. Under **Permissions and Management**, click **Apply label to items in this library**.
    
6. In **Settings-Apply Label**, select the appropriate label, and then click **Save**.
    
7. Close the tab for the SharePoint Online site.
    
8. Repeat steps 3-8 to assign Office 365 labels to your additional SharePoint Online sites.
    
Here is your resulting configuration.

## DLP policies for your SharePoint Online sites

Use these steps to configure a DLP policy that notifies users when they share a document on a SharePoint Online sensitive team site outside the organization.

1. From the **Microsoft Office Home** tab, click the **Admin** tile.
    
2. From the new **Office Admin center** tab of your browser, click **Admin centers > Security &amp; Compliance**.
