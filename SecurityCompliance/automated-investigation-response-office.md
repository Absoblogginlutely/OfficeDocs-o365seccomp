# Automated Investigation and Response (AIR) with Office 365 Threat Intelligence

Automated Investigation and Response within Office 365 Threat Intelligence allows you to run automated investigation and remediation to well-known threats that exist today. Security playbooks are at the heart of automation in Microsoft Threat Protection, so we want to give you a high-level understanding of what a security playbook does.  Security playbooks are back-end policies that admins can select as part of security policies.  The security playbooks are based on common real-world security scenarios.  A Security playbook is triggered when an alert is fired within your organization. Once the alert triggers, the associated playbook is run. The playbook itself then takes over, it runs the investigation looking at all the associated meta data (emails, users, subjects, senders et al) based on its findings it will then recommend a set of actions the administrator can take to control and mitigate the threat. (Initially for phase 1, the recommendation actions to take will require an administrator to approve, phase 2 will have the option to allow the feature to automatically take the actions with no administration interaction required)

Since Microsoft provides services to one of the largest bases of customers across the globe, we have seen almost everything.  So, we leverage our experience and design playbooks which tackle the most frequent threats that we have experienced across our ecosystem.
