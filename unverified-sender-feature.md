# Identify suspicious messages in Outlook.com and Outlook on the web

To prevent phishing messages from reaching your mailbox, Outlook.com and Outlook on the web verify that the sender is who they say they are and mark suspicious messages as junk email.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When a message is marked as a phishing scam, Outlook.com and Outlook on the web display a warning at the top of the page, but any links in the message can still be opened.

## How can I identify a suspicious message in my inbox?
